# Effects

* Total: return a value for every possible input
* Deterministic: return the same value for the same input
* Inculpable: no (direct) interaction with the world or program state.

Effects refer to the core behaviour of a monad, for example:

An Option *monad* models optionality as an effect

A Try *monad* models failure as an effect

A Future *monad* models latency as an effect.

An IO *monad* models side effects
